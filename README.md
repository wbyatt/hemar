# Hemar

Named for the oldest container in the world, this is a simple container engine, inspired by the [Containers From Scratch](https://github.com/lizrice/containers-from-scratch) talks by Liz Rice

## Usage
Right now, `hemar pull [image]` and `hemar run [image] [command]` work.

## Licensing

For the time being, this is substantially similar to the Liz Rice repository, so it's MIT (c) 2017 Liz Rice. If I make substantial changes, it'll retain MIT.
